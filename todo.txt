There should be some system for counting how many times some route has been called, and take a note if it's a spam
maybe?

should have ability to connect with frontend (requires CORS) or with any http client

should have ability to log in, create a new user, and also a feature to block creating new accounts

expiry of link (either exact date or day/month/year from now)

backend source code in one module
integration tests in one module + testcontainers
frontend kotlin/react in one module

add docker for every dependency like database and similar

where to store routes and user info?
* in filesystem, so it doesn't depend on database
* in a database (short url as a key, long url as a value)

url path to give short url and get back as a json/text just the response what would it redirect to
    maybe even as a query parameter in root path

***What data structure would work as a map and how to map it in database?

job to check if there are urls that are broken - return 404, 500 etc.
    configure if they should be removed permanently,
    or it would be better just to let the user know and let him decide on the actions
