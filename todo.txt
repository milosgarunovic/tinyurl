There should be some system for counting how many times some route has been called, and take a note if it's a spam
maybe?

should have ability to connect with frontend (requires CORS) or with any http client

should have ability to log in, create a new user, and also a feature to block creating new accounts

backend source code in one module
integration tests in one module + testcontainers
frontend kotlin/react in one module

***What data structure would work as a map and how to map it in database?
    Or just use regular database with index on shortUrl, see if it's valid point to use shortUrl as id
---
urls can be low letter case, so I'd need to test if it works like "/api/tinyUrl" and "/api/tinyurl", maybe even change
the path... for now in tests this doesn't work
---
create a user, TinyUrl should be related to a user if one exists
can continue developing this way and then migrate or allow multiple options to users (basic, jwt, oauth...)
need to make a create user path
