There should be some system for counting how many times some route has been called, and take a note if it's a spam
maybe?

should have ability to connect with frontend (requires CORS) or with any http client

backend source code in one module
integration tests in one module + testcontainers
frontend kotlin/react in one module

Recursive adding shouldn't be allowed, like if it's from the same origin, you can't create a URL.
For example, we're hosting this on test.com, we create some url and get test.com/dwUcNQ20. Now if we want to add that
url to get another one, we should block this because it doesn't make sense to do something like this.
